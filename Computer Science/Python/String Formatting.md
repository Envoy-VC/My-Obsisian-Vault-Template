## String Formatting

### % operator

```python
>>> name = 'Pete'
>>> 'Hello %s' % name
"Hello Pete"
```

We can use the `%x` format specifier to convert an int value to a string:

```python
>>> num = 5
>>> 'I have %x apples' % num
"I have 5 apples"
```

Note: For new code, using [str.format](#string-formatting-strformat) or [f-strings](#formatted-string-literals-or-f-strings-python-36) (Python 3.6+) is strongly recommended over the `%` operator.

### String Formatting (str.format)

Python 3 introduced a new way to do string formatting that was later back-ported to Python 2.7. This makes the syntax for string formatting more regular.

```python
>>> name = 'John'
>>> age = 20'

>>> "Hello I'm {}, my age is {}".format(name, age)
"Hello I'm John, my age is 20"
```

```python
>>> "Hello I'm {0}, my age is {1}".format(name, age)
"Hello I'm John, my age is 20"
```

The official [Python 3.x documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=sprintf#printf-style-string-formatting) recommend `str.format` over the `%` operator:

> The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries correctly). Using the newer formatted string literals or the str.format() interface helps avoid these errors. These alternatives also provide more powerful, flexible and extensible approaches to formatting text.

### Lazy string formatting

You would only use `%s` string formatting on functions that can do lazy parameters evaluation,
the most common being logging:

Prefer:

```python
>>> name = "alice"
>>> logging.debug("User name: %s", name)
```

Over:

```python
>>> logging.debug("User name: {}".format(name))
```

Or:

```python
>>> logging.debug("User name: " + name)
```

### Formatted String Literals or f-strings (Python 3.6+)

```python
>>> name = 'Elizabeth'
>>> f'Hello {name}!'
'Hello Elizabeth!
```

It is even possible to do inline arithmetic with it:

```python
>>> a = 5
>>> b = 10
>>> f'Five plus ten is {a + b} and not {2 * (a + b)}.'
'Five plus ten is 15 and not 30.'
```

---

### Template Strings

A simpler and less powerful mechanism, but it is recommended when handling format strings generated by users. Due to their reduced complexity template strings are a safer choice.

```python
>>> from string import Template
>>> name = 'Elizabeth'
>>> t = Template('Hey $name!')
>>> t.substitute(name=name)
'Hey Elizabeth!'
```
