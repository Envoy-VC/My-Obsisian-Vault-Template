## Reading and Writing Files

### The File Reading/Writing Process

To read/write to a file in Python, you will want to use the `with`
statement, which will close the file for you after you are done.

---

### Opening and reading files with the open() function

```python
>>> with open('C:\\Users\\your_home_folder\\hello.txt') as hello_file:
...     hello_content = hello_file.read()
>>> hello_content
'Hello World!'

>>> # Alternatively, you can use the *readlines()* method to get a list of string values from the file, one string for each line of text:

>>> with open('sonnet29.txt') as sonnet_file:
...     sonnet_file.readlines()
[When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,\n', ' I all alone beweep my
outcast state,\n', And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\n', And
look upon myself and curse my fate,']

>>> # You can also iterate through the file line by line:
>>> with open('sonnet29.txt') as sonnet_file:
...     for line in sonnet_file: # note the new line character will be included in the line
...         print(line, end='')

When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast state,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself and curse my fate,
```

---

### Writing to Files

```python
>>> with open('bacon.txt', 'w') as bacon_file:
...     bacon_file.write('Hello world!\n')
13

>>> with open('bacon.txt', 'a') as bacon_file:
...     bacon_file.write('Bacon is not a vegetable.')
25

>>> with open('bacon.txt') as bacon_file:
...     content = bacon_file.read()

>>> print(content)
Hello world!
Bacon is not a vegetable.
```

### Saving Variables with the shelve Module

To save variables:

```python
>>> import shelve

>>> cats = ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon']
>>> with shelve.open('mydata') as shelf_file:
...     shelf_file['cats'] = cats
```

To open and read variables:

```python
>>> with shelve.open('mydata') as shelf_file:
...     print(type(shelf_file))
...     print(shelf_file['cats'])
<class 'shelve.DbfilenameShelf'>
['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon']
```

Just like dictionaries, shelf values have keys() and values() methods that will return list-like values of the keys and values in the shelf. Since these methods return list-like values instead of true lists, you should pass them to the list() function to get them in list form.

```python
>>> with shelve.open('mydata') as shelf_file:
...     print(list(shelf_file.keys()))
...     print(list(shelf_file.values()))
['cats']
[['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon']]
```

---

### Saving Variables with the pprint.pformat() Function

```python
>>> import pprint

>>> cats = [{'name': 'Zophie', 'desc': 'chubby'}, {'name': 'Pooka', 'desc': 'fluffy'}]

>>> pprint.pformat(cats)
"[{'desc': 'chubby', 'name': 'Zophie'}, {'desc': 'fluffy', 'name': 'Pooka'}]"

>>> with open('myCats.py', 'w') as file_obj:
...     file_obj.write('cats = {}\n'.format(pprint.pformat(cats)))
83
```

### Reading ZIP Files

```python
>>> import zipfile, os

>>> os.chdir('C:\\')    # move to the folder with example.zip
>>> with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip') as example_zip:
...     print(example_zip.namelist())
...     spam_info = example_zip.getinfo('spam.txt')
...     print(spam_info.file_size)
...     print(spam_info.compress_size)
...     print('Compressed file is %sx smaller!' % (round(spam_info.file_size / spam_info.compress_size, 2)))

['spam.txt', 'cats/', 'cats/catnames.txt', 'cats/zophie.jpg']
13908
3828
'Compressed file is 3.63x smaller!'
```

---

### Extracting from ZIP Files

The extractall() method for ZipFile objects extracts all the files and folders from a ZIP file into the current working directory.

```python
>>> import zipfile, os

>>> os.chdir('C:\\')    # move to the folder with example.zip

>>> with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip') as example_zip:
...     example_zip.extractall()
```

The extract() method for ZipFile objects will extract a single file from the ZIP file. Continue the interactive shell example:

```python
>>> with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip') as example_zip:
...     print(example_zip.extract('spam.txt'))
...     print(example_zip.extract('spam.txt', 'C:\\some\\new\\folders'))
'C:\\spam.txt'
'C:\\some\\new\\folders\\spam.txt'
```

---

### Creating and Adding to ZIP Files

```python
>>> import zipfile

>>> with zipfile.ZipFile('new.zip', 'w') as new_zip:
...     new_zip.write('spam.txt', compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
```

This code will create a new ZIP file named new.zip that has the compressed contents of spam.txt.
