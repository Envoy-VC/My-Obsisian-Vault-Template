# Variables

A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name.

When you’re using variables in Python, you need to adhere to a few rules and guidelines. Breaking some of these rules will cause errors; other guide-lines just help you write code that’s easier to read and understand. Be sure to keep the following variable rules in mind:

- Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. For instance, you can call a variable *`message_1`* but not *`1_message`*.

-  Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names. For example, *`greeting_message`* works, but *`greeting message`* will cause errors.

-  Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word print.

-  Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, `name` is better than `n`, `student_name` is better than `s_n`, and `name_length` is better than `length_of_persons_name`.
